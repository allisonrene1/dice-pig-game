# dice-pig-game

This is a recreation of the pig game. Player 1 starts by rolling the dice. If he or she rolls a number above 1,
then that number is added to the "current" window. Player can continue rolling the dice as much as he or she wants until clicking
"hold", which will save the score and then automatically switch to the other player. However, if the player rolls a 1, then their "current" window score is eliminated and reduced to zero; the game will then automatically switch to the other player. Player 2 will continue playing the game in the same fashion. Whoever reaches 100 first is the winner. A new game can be commenced afterwards by clicking the "new game" button at the top.

Comments can be found in the script.js file detailing which blocks of code serve which function.
